1) You need to setup a connection to your GitHub repo where these CloudFormation templates reside. Be sure to use the "Install a new app" option when setting up the connection. This installs the "AWS Connector for GitHub" app in your GitHub account which allows it to access your repositories using OAuth.

2) You must have CloudTrail enabled for automatic DNS record creation to work. It is recommended that you create an organization trail so that all events across the organization are captured.
